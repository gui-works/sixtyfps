# SixtyFPS

This crate is the main entry point for embedding user interfaces designed with
[SixtyFPS UI](https://www.sixtyfps.io/) in Rust programs.

Included in this documentation is also the [language reference](langref/index.html).

## How to use:

The user interfaces are described in the `.60` design markup language. There are two ways
of including the design in Rust:

 - The `.60` code is inline in a macro.
 - The `.60` code in external files compiled with `build.rs`

 This markup code is translated to Rust code and each component is turned into a Rust
 struct with functions to instantiated, show or access properties. This documentation
 includes an [example](generated_code/struct.SampleComponent.html) of how the API looks
 like.

### The .60 code in a macro

This method combines your Rust code with the `.60` design markup in one file, using a macro:

```rust
sixtyfps::sixtyfps!{
    HelloWorld := Text {
        text: "hello world";
        color: black;
    }
}
fn main() {
#   return; // Don't run a window in an example
    HelloWorld::new().run()
}
```

### The .60 file in external files compiled with `build.rs`

This method allows you to a separate `.60` file on the file system, which works well if
your design becomes bigger and you split it up across multiple files. You need to use a
so-called [build script](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html)
to trigger the compilation of the `.60` file.

In your Cargo.toml:

FIXME! set the version

```toml
[package]
...
build = "build.rs"

[dependencies]
sixtyfps = "*"
...

[build-dependencies]
sixtyfps-build = "*"
```

In the `build.rs` file:

```ignore
fn main() {
    sixtyfps_build::compile("ui/hello.60");
}
```

Then in your main file

```ignore
sixtyfps::include_modules!();
fn main() {
    HelloWorld::new().run()
}
```

### Types

The types used for properties in `.60` design markup each translate to specific types in Rust.
The follow table summarizes the entire mapping:

| `.60` Type | Rust Type | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int` | `i32` | |
| `float` | `f32` | |
| `string` | [`sixtyfps::SharedString`](struct.SharedString.html) | A reference-counted string type that can be easily converted to a str reference. |
| `color` | [`sixtyfps::Color`](struct.Color.html) | |
| `length` | `f32` | The unit are physical pixels. |
| `logical_length` | `f32` | At run-time, logical lengths are automatically translated to physical pixels using the device pixel ratio. |
